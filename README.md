# Reddit - My upvoted posts

Wanted to learn how to use the reddit api and combine it with discord webhooks.

Loop through either all the posts I have upvoted, or the _best, top, hot_ pages and saves the title, subreddit and url for the posts.

I first wrote the python script in the beginning of my programming career. Then I rewrote the project in node.
